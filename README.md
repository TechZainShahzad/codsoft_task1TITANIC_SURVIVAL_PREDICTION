# Titanic Survival Prediction Project
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is derived from the Titanic Beginners Competition, combining the test file and gender submission. The goal is to achieve a high prediction accuracy, aiming for at least 70% accuracy.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno
Data Cleaning and Exploration: Standard data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and visualization are performed using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizing various classifiers such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for survival prediction.

# Key Visualizations
Histograms and correlation analysis for features like Age, Parch, SibSp, and Family onboard.
Survival rates over the number of relatives onboard, categorized by Parch, SibSp, and Family onboard.
Gender-based survival rates.
Fare distribution among survivors and non-survivors.
Analysis of survival rates based on passenger titles.

# Feature Engineering
Creation of the 'Family onboard' feature by combining 'Parch' and 'SibSp.'
Extraction of titles from passenger names for additional insights.
Title Categorization
Categorization of passenger titles into broader categories (e.g., Mrs, Mr, Notable, Master) for better analysis.
